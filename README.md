# helloworld-transifex-rtd

This project demonstrates demonstrate a continuous integration and deployment workflow involving
Sphinx, Transifex, GitHub Actions, and ReadTheDocs. I created it to supplement the documentation in
https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/pull/475 describing how to enable translations of Sphinx
